# üó≥Ô∏è Vote Choice and Candidate Characteristics (ANES 2016‚Äì2024)

This project investigates how **voters‚Äô perceptions of presidential candidates‚Äô personal characteristics** ‚Äî such as honesty, competence, empathy, and leadership ‚Äî influence **vote choice** across the **2016, 2020, and 2024 U.S. elections**.  

Data come from the **American National Election Studies (ANES)** time-series datasets, analyzed in **R** using logistic regression, predicted probabilities, and visualization techniques.

---

## üß† Research Overview
Voter evaluations of candidates‚Äô personalities often shape electoral outcomes beyond party identification and ideology.  
This study compares how personal trait perceptions have predicted vote choice across three election cycles, testing whether the strength and direction of these effects have changed over time.

## üß∞ Methods & Tools
- **R** ‚Äì Statistical modeling and visualization  
  - Packages: `tidyverse`, `ggplot2`, `dplyr`, `broom`, `margins`
- **Models:** Logistic regressions predicting vote choice as a function of perceived personal characteristics  
- **Visualizations:** Forest plots, histograms, and predicted probability plots  
- **Data:** American National Election Studies (ANES) 2016, 2020, 2024

## üìà Findings

Across all three election years ‚Äî **2016, 2020, and 2024** ‚Äî perceptions of **candidates‚Äô personal characteristics** had a measurable and consistent influence on how Americans voted.  

### üó≥Ô∏è Key Results
- **Leadership and honesty** remained the strongest predictors of vote choice in every cycle.  
- In **2016**, evaluations of **honesty and empathy** were sharply polarized between Trump and Clinton voters, reflecting the centrality of trust and temperament in that election.  
- In **2020**, traits related to **competence and empathy** grew in importance, particularly in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic.  
- By **2024**, the data indicate increasing **ideological sorting**, with voters‚Äô evaluations of candidate traits aligning more tightly with **partisanship and ideology**.  
- Positive trait perceptions substantially increased the **predicted probability** of voting for a candidate ‚Äî even when controlling for ideology and party ID.

### üîç Patterns Over Time
- The strength of personality-based predictors of vote choice **has not declined**, but their **association with partisanship** has intensified.  
- Trait evaluations that once reflected cross-party appeal (e.g., competence, empathy) now **track more closely with partisan identity**.  
- Visualizations from predicted probability models and forest plots show **widening partisan gaps** in how voters interpret the same candidate characteristics.

### üí¨ Interpretation
These results suggest that **personal evaluations have become a partisan lens**, not an independent heuristic.  
While voters still claim to value character and leadership, those judgments now largely **mirror partisan loyalties**, reinforcing polarization rather than moderating it.
