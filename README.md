# üó≥Ô∏è Vote Choice and Candidate Characteristics (ANES 2016‚Äì2024)

This project investigates how **voters‚Äô perceptions of presidential candidates‚Äô personal characteristics** ‚Äî such as honesty, competence, empathy, and leadership ‚Äî influence **vote choice** across the **2016, 2020, and 2024 U.S. elections**.  

Data come from the **American National Election Studies (ANES)** time-series datasets, analyzed in **R** using logistic regression, predicted probabilities, and visualization techniques.

## üß† Research Overview
Voter evaluations of candidates‚Äô personalities often shape electoral outcomes beyond party identification and ideology.  
This study compares how personal trait perceptions have predicted vote choice across three election cycles, testing whether the strength and direction of these effects have changed over time.

- **R** ‚Äì Statistical modeling and visualization  
  - Packages: `tidyverse`, `ggplot2`, `dplyr`, `broom`, `margins`
- **Models:** Logistic regressions predicting vote choice as a function of perceived personal characteristics  
- **Visualizations:** Forest plots, histograms, and predicted probability plots  
- **Data:** American National Election Studies (ANES) 2016, 2020, 2024

## üóìÔ∏è 2016 Election

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Statistical Findings

Regression models estimate the impact of voters‚Äô evaluations of candidates‚Äô personal characteristics on their probability of voting for the major party candidates.  
The models also include **demographic and policy-related control variables** (e.g., age, gender, education, income, racial identification, ideology, and issue attitudes), which are **not shown in these visualizations** but are incorporated in the full regression analyses.

#### Odds Ratios

#### Predicted Probabilities

**Findings Summary:**  
- Traits related to **honesty** and **empathy** were significant predictors of 2016 vote choice.  
- Strong partisan sorting is visible in both party ID and ideology distributions.  
- Candidate evaluations reflected sharp polarization between Trump and Clinton voters.

## üóìÔ∏è 2020 Election

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Descriptive Overview

Descriptive visualizations for 2020 show how voter **party identification**, **ideological self-placement**, and **trait valence** continued to polarize during a highly nationalized election.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Statistical Findings

Regression models include **demographic characteristics** (age, gender, education, race, income) and **policy preferences** (e.g., economic and social issue scales) as controls, though these are omitted from the figures below for clarity.

#### Odds Ratios
![2020 Odds Ratios](https://github.com/antonycj/Candidate-Perception-and-Vote-Choice/blob/main/2020_odds_ratio.png)

#### Predicted Probabilities
![2020 Predicted Probabilities](https://github.com/antonycj/Candidate-Perception-and-Vote-Choice/blob/main/predicted_probabilities.png)

**Findings Summary:**  
- **Competence** and **empathy** became increasingly important in 2020, reflecting issue salience during the COVID-19 pandemic.  
- Predicted probabilities show that positive candidate trait evaluations significantly increased the likelihood of voting for that candidate, even after accounting for ideology and policy preferences.  
- The ideological divide in trait perceptions widened substantially compared to 2016.

## üóìÔ∏è 2024 Election

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Descriptive Overview

The 2024 ANES data highlight deepened polarization in voter **party ID**, **ideological identification**, and **candidate evaluations**.  
Trait perceptions have become increasingly sorted along partisan lines.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Statistical Findings

Regression models control for **demographic**, **ideological**, and **policy-related variables**, including age, gender, education, income, partisanship, and key issue positions.  
These variables are **not visualized below**, but they are incorporated in all model estimates to isolate the effect of candidate trait perceptions.

#### Odds Ratios

#### Predicted Probabilities
![2024 Predicted Probabilities](https://github.com/antonycj/Candidate-Perception-and-Vote-Choice/blob/main/predicted_probabilities_2024.png)

**Findings Summary:**  
- **Leadership** and **honesty** remain the strongest predictors of vote choice, but their effects are now closely intertwined with **partisan identification**.  
- Predicted probability plots show near-total alignment between partisan ID and candidate evaluation ‚Äî evidence of **ideological sorting**.  
- Voters increasingly evaluate candidate character through a **partisan lens**, reinforcing polarization rather than moderating it.

## üß† Project Summary

This project analyzes how voters‚Äô perceptions of presidential candidates‚Äô **personal characteristics** ‚Äî such as honesty, leadership, empathy, and competence ‚Äî influence **vote choice** across the **2016, 2020, and 2024 U.S. elections**.  

Using data from the **American National Election Studies (ANES)**, I conducted a comparative analysis across three cycles to assess how personal evaluations shape voter behavior and how these effects have evolved amid increasing polarization.

From a data perspective, this project demonstrates skills that are directly transferable to analytical roles:

- **Data Cleaning & Preparation:** Extracted and transformed multi-year survey data with over 10,000 respondents per cycle using R and Python.  
- **Exploratory Data Analysis:** Visualized distributions of ideology, party identification, and candidate trait evaluations using `ggplot2`.  
- **Statistical Modeling:** Built and interpreted **logistic regression models** including demographic and policy controls to isolate the effect of personality perceptions on vote choice.  
- **Predictive Analytics:** Estimated **predicted probabilities** and **odds ratios** to quantify the marginal effect of candidate traits.  
- **Data Visualization:** Created interpretable, publication-quality graphics (PCA plots, histograms, predicted probability charts) for both academic and public communication.  
- **Communication:** Synthesized technical results into clear narratives about how voter evaluations and ideology interact over time.

### Key Insight
Across all three elections, candidate evaluations remain a **strong and consistent predictor** of vote choice ‚Äî but over time, these perceptions have become **deeply partisan**, reflecting broader ideological sorting in the American electorate.
